## About

Octolib is the school hub for [ESI SBA](https://www.esi-sba.dz/) students that shares:

- School materials (lessons, exercices with solution, labs...).
- Previous exams with solution.

## Contribution guidlines

We welcome contributions to this hub. In fact they're necessary for the relevance of the resources, and thus must be updated on a yearly basis. Here are some rules for the sake of consistency and regulation:

- All resources must be hosted on Google Drive.
- Folder structure must follow the format below.
- Stick to PDF formats. Export/convert other formats to PDF.
- If some document is only available in physical format, kindly scan it with your phone. Microsoft Lens is a great app for that: download from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.officelens&pcampaignid=web_share) or [Apple Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-lens-pdf-scanner/id975925059).
- No pirated content is allowed.

### Folder structure and file naming conventions

**Note**: Folders are mostly named in French abbreviations, because it is the teaching language of ESI SBA.
