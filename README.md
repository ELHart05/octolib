## About

A student-managed library for [ESI SBA (École Supérieure en Informatique de Sidi Bel Abbès)](https://www.esi-sba.dz/) hosting lessons, labs, and previous exams.

## Contribution guidelines

We welcome contributions, in fact this project needs them on a yearly basis in order to survive and stay relevant. Here are some guidelines to ease the process:

- All resources must be hosted on Google Drive.
- Folder structure must follow the format below.
- Stick to PDF formats. Export/convert other formats to PDF.
- If some document is only available in physical format, kindly scan it with your phone. Microsoft Lens is a great app for that: download from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.officelens&pcampaignid=web_share) or [Apple Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-lens-pdf-scanner/id975925059).
- No pirated content is allowed.

### Folder structure and file naming conventions

**Note**: Folders are mostly named in French abbreviations, because it is the teaching language of ESI SBA.

Google Drive folder (one for each class. For example: 1CP, 2CP...):
