## About

Octolib is the school hub for [ESI SBA](https://www.esi-sba.dz/) students that shares:

- School materials (lessons, exercices with solution, labs...).
- Previous exams with solution.

## Contribution guidlines

We welcome contributions to this hub. In fact they're necessary for the relevance of the resources, and thus must be updated on a yearly basis. Here are some rules for the sake of consistency and regulation:

- All resources must be hosted on Google Drive.
- Folder structure must follow the format below.
- No pirated content is allowed.

### Folder structure format

**Note**: Folders are mostly named in French abbreviations, because that is the used language at school.
